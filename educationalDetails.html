								<h2><b>Master's in Applied Computer Science</b></h2>
								<p>My quest for an institution that would help me transgress the tenets of science and give me unbridled freedom to explore new avenues in my fields of interest led me to <a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/">Northwest Missouri State University</a>. I have opted for <a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/academics/graduate/masters/applied-computer-science.htm">Applied Computer Science</a> program at Northwest University, which is a sixteen-month programme that provides hands-on training in today's high-demand technologies. I am enjoying pursuing master's with learning edge-cutting technologies at the university.</p>
								<h2><b>Training at Infosys Global Education Center</b></h2>
								
								<p>I joined Infosys with the designation of Systems Engineer Trainee, and got trained <a href="https://www.infosys.com/careers/graduates/global-education-center.html">Infosys Global Education Center</a> at Mysuru, India. During the training, I cleared the generic training which includes Programming fundamentals in Python, Data Structures, Database management system and Software Engineering. The training also included stream training which covered Java Programming, Spring framework, Hibernate framework, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, typescript, Angular 4 and have successfully developed an e-commerce web application using these technologies. I am an active participant in personality and professional development workshops which helped me to improve Networking, Interpersonal, Presentational and Communication skills.</p>
								<h2><b>Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering</b></h2>
								<p>I have completed my under graduation at <a href="http://me.mrec.ac.in/">Malla Reddy Engineering College(MREC)</a>, Hyderabad. Apart from my major course I got interested in computer science courses too. My interest in coding led me to participate in various coding workshops and competitions conducted in the college, which ultimately led me to get a job in one of the largest Indian IT companies, Infosys. </p>
								<h2><b>Intermediate Education</b></h2>
								<p>I have completed intermediate education in <a href="https://srichaitanya.net/">Sri Chaitanya Junior College</a> kukatpally hyderabad.
								My interest in math made me choose Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as major subjects after completing secondary school education with 93%. Then, I went on to complete my pre-University education with 92.5% and I stood in the top 15% in the engineering entrance test. Thus, I got a chance to pursue Mechanical Engineering in one of the reputed colleges of my state.
								</p>
								<h2><b>Secondary Education (Schooling)</b></h2>
								<p>I have completed my schooling at <a href="http://www.jyothividyalayahighschoolbhel.com/about-sidquest.html">Jyothi Vidyalaya High School</a> in BHEL, Ramachandra Puram, Hyderabad. I have experienced the most comfortable learning and the school has also given me the confidence to achieve and be myself in a positive learning environment.</p>
